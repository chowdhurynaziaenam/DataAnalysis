<b>Exploratory Data Analysis on IRIS Dataset</b>

This project explores and analyses the Iris data set.The data set contains 3 classes such as Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica of 50 instances each, making a total of 150 observations where each class refers to a type of iris plant. The number of features is 4 such as Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), and Petal Width (cm). It further explores relationship between the features using different kinds of plots. It further develops the model and assesses the predictive performance of 6 Machine learning classifiers based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy,recall, f1-score and precision. All the classifiers showed very good performance in classifying the species of Iris flowers based on their features.
